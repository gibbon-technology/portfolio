# Welcome to RedRockSoftware

### This file is intended to walk you through the features included in my app.

### First off, I used the MERN stack to build this website. For those who don't know, MERN is:

- ### MongoDB
- ### Express
- ### React
- ### Node.js

### I have build this website over the last month completely by hand (no copy and paste). I did use a few libraries on the frontend and backend, but I wanted to keep the marjority of the codebase completely handmade, after all, that is how you learn.<br/><br/>This website continues to be a work in progress, as I am always working on new features, as well as bug-fixes.<br/><br/>I am currently looking for work in web development, so the idea behind this project is to show off my skills on both the frontend and the backend. As you are reading this, if you happen to work for a company that is actively hiring, I would love to hear from you! My direct email is "ryan.codes@icloud.com".

# Chat

### Live chat app which allows ADMIN users to chat with any user,<br/>while restricting NON-ADMIN users to only chatting with me<br/>(Ryan @ RedRockSoftware). Chats are color-coded to help<br/>distinguish between sent/received. Chats are currently being<br/>updated at 5 second intervals, allowing quick, automatic<br/>updates to the UI, while not being a burden on my server.

### ADMIN view
